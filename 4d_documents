Any webpage is essentially 4d. And should be thought of this way.

A piece of paper is 2-dimensional. The Material Design specs draw an important point to our attention however. That is, that depth on a page is important, and they offer built-in classes for an easier presentation of depth and shadow. This spec treats html documents as essentially 3dimensional. However, the aspect of time can also be thought of as a dimension in a dynamic web page, as elements might change and slide shows might switch elements in and out. Thus, it is helpful to be aware that we actually already think of a dynamic, material design web page as varying along the four coordinates x,y,z,t. With dynamic data or various interaction methods, we can think of a web page having more than 4 dimensions. Each 

When html/css/javascript is written, it is written along these four dimensions. A javascript array of n-depth can represent n dimensional data. When applied to a certain element. It increases the dimension of that element by n dimensions.

A text document at any point of time is only 2 dimensions, there is no depth to pure text files, and they only change in time as we edit them. We represent the 4+dimensions on a page by including tags within tags and with multidimensional arrays. 
Below is what a typical abstraction of an html page might be. A letter is added for each element subsetted from its parent, and a letter is changed between siblings. 

-A
    - AA
        - AAA
        - AAB
    - AB
        - ABA
        - ABB
-B
    - BA
        - BAA
        - BAB
    - BB
        - BBA
        - BBB

This can also be represented by the following array, which looks very similar to a JSON document.

(A(AA(AAA,AAB),AB(ABA,ABB)),B(BA(BAA,BAB),BB(BBA,BBB)))
